Here‚Äôs a revised version of the prompt that provides clear and detailed instructions for generating code:

---

**Prompt:**

Please adjust, modify, and enhance the functionality of this application (this file is the entire codebase). Here are the specific requirements:

0. **Forms**
    - Change all the forms of the apps to use the recommended structure for shadcn/ui forms. They should use the @/components/ui/form components from shadcn/ui, a Form component, a zodResolver, zod for the form schema and react hook forms to handle the form

1. **Views and Tabs:**
   - When adding a view, it refers to a new tab in the `AdminDashboard` component, which can be accessed by changing the `activeTab` state.
   - When generating tables or repeated elements, define the elements as arrays (table headers, select elements, ...) and map over them in the template to shorten the generated code
   - Render lists of items in templates as mappings from data extracted to a const array to reduce code output.
   - Extract repeated string to an global strings array to shorten code output

2. **State Management:**
   - Important: Use separate Zustand stores based on logical data grouping (adminstore should be remove). All operations should specify the tenant and update data accordingly in the tenant specific store. Have per tenant storage for tenant data (per tenant storage key), and a global storage key for global data. The cart should also be seperate and be stored per user per location
   - Spread the functionnality between a globalStore and a tenantStore, make sure to make the tenantStore dynamic based on the current tenant
   - Verify that the user updating data is associated with the tenant and has the necessary permissions. All application data must be tenant-keyed.
   - All the views of the app should initialize the tenant store based on the current tenant
   - Do not call Hooks inside useEffect
   - Modify how the tenant store is initialized, don't use a hook with useEffect, pass the currentTenant to createstore function in the components

3. **Global and Scoped Stores:**
   - Users and tenants are global entities and should be stored in a global store. Other data should be scoped by tenant or user.
   - The cart must have its own store with items scoped by tenant and `placeId`.

4. **Seed Management:**
   - Manage storage keys, data, versions, and perform seeding or resetting for tenants or global data (e.g., items, tenants, roles, permissions, users). Prepare and seed useful generic data. Auto-seed data on first ever initialisation of a store then always restore from storage.
   - Seed roles: admin, shop manager, pro user, user
   - Seed a user for each role
   - Seed a default tenant and use this tenant by default when none is selected

5. **Permissions and Roles:**
   - When checking permissions, pass the role and user object to a global permissions check function.
   - Preserve the super admin toggle feature and allow super admin to bypass checks

6. **UI and Styling:**
   - Do not assume the `--background` variable is set; use Tailwind CSS classes explicitly for backgrounds and text colors.
   - Add console logging with various info leves via a custom method throughout the app that is enabled by default but can be disabled via a flag.
   - Implement auto-hide functionality for the sidebar menu on mobile, revealing it on click.

7. **Client Management:**
   - Add a "My Clients" view that lists a tenant clients with a data table, client details, search, filter, pagination, CRUD functionality, client details, previous invoices, support module integration, and basic CRM actions.

8. **Order Management:**
   - In the "My Orders" view, add an option to start a new support request for a specific order or generically via a UI button.
   - In the "Orders" view, display and add ui to manage support requests on the order detail view
   - Add a custom files input to an order to allow admins to join an invoice to an order, show a download icon on the "my orders" client order when relevant.

9. **Authentication and Checkout:**
    - Add a "Create a new account" checkbox in the checkout form, check it by default, if it is unchecked then reveal 2 buttons: signup and register. Make logging in required if the "Create a new account" checkbox is unchecked.
    - On the tenant settings screen, add an option to toggle "checkout as guest," bypassing sign-in requirement if enabled.

10. **Open Hours and Slots:**
    - Ensure the UI facilitates inserting non-overlapping periods for open hours or pickup slots.

11. **App Initialization and Versioning:**
    - Track if the app has been initialized and present the seed screen if not. Keep track of the app version in the global store.

12. **E-commerce Features:**
    - Create a public e-commerce shop view with category and tag filters, sorting, pagination, and per-page options. Only list products with an "enable listing" boolean set to true.
    - Add settings to enable or disable the e-commerce view per tenant.

13. **Settings Management:**
    - Add horizontal tabs in the settings section for managing various tenant settings.
    - Include functionality to manage HTML email templates for different app events, allowing selection of email targets (e.g., customer, tenant admin, custom list).

14. **Event Handling and Messaging:**
    - Trigger relevant events (e.g., signup, order, low stock) to possibly send messages to the tenant.

15. **Coupon Codes:**
    - Add a screen to create and manage coupon codes for discounts on items, item groups, shipping, or the entire cart. Adjust order screens to handle coupon logic and entry.

16. **Meal Plans:**
    - Track items added by meal plans and relate them to the meal plan ID. Group items visually by meal in the cart and display meal info on receipts and orders.
    - Add configurable messages to meal plans, schedule publication dates, and prevent orders after cutoff dates. Add UI banners for approaching and passed cutoff times.

17. **Shipping Methods:**
    - Enable or disable shipping methods for each tenant location. Add a "Click and Collect" toggle with extra settings for pickup times and capacity.
    - Add a toggle on the shipping method configuration screen to enable "Click and collect" for a method. If the method is enable reveal extra settings for the method to configure opening pickup time to show to clients for the days of the week. Each day should have a repeater to add multiple open an closed times for the day with configurable pickup capacity per slot. Also add a global exceptions repeater to configure exception for holidays (closure time)
    -On the meal ordering screen if the client chooses a pick and collect method or if the only default shipping method is a pick and collect one, show a sleek ui to select the pickup time in a list of pickup times available for a chosen day. Allow user to add a custom message sent to the vendor with the order

18. **Additional Screens:**
    - Add screens for listing and viewing event messages, fake emails sent log crud

19. **Pickup Time Selection:**
    - For pick and collect methods, show a UI when checking out to choose a date and then select a pickup time in the remaining slots (other slots should be disabled) and allow optional customer messages with orders.

20. **Support Requests:**
   - Add a "My Support Requests" view for users and a "Support Requests" admin panel for shop managers. Ensure UI handles support request creation, and email triggering for both generic and entity-specific requests (e.g., client orders).

21. **Code Generation:**
    - Generate complete source code for all screens and features described. Do not shorten or omit any part of the code. Always provide the entire code and avoid using placeholders like:
    // ... (previous imports and type definitions remain unchanged) // ... (rest of the components remain unchanged) // ... (previous type definitions remain unchanged) // ... (previous state properties remain unchanged) // ... (previous components remain unchanged) // ... (all other component definitions remain unchanged) // ... (all state properties and methods remain unchanged) // ... (all type definitions and other imports remain unchanged) // (This component's implementation is omitted for brevity) // I'll provide the full, unabbreviated code for each component and feature. // ... (implement other methods for managing tenant-specific data) // Import all necessary types and interfaces here // Add other global actions here // Add other xxx actions here

Ensure the implementation meets all the described requirements without abbreviations or omissions.
Make sure not to introduce extra line breaks or break my code when I ask you to continue generating code.
Never omit any code ! Never. Don't respond with : Here's the updated and expanded code. Always send the data back in the format v0.dev expects
Send the full implementation of the code of my response back in the format of one single .tsx file
Do not respond: The task is too extensive to complete in a single response

21.  **Sync view**
    - Add a sync management view that allows adding connections to remote apis
    - Each added sync task should have a data source, an entity type, a direction (from remote, or to remote), a scheduler, a history log and a publish/unpulish functionality
    - Allow a sync to be of type : WordPress, Prestashop, Shopify, Activ, or custom
    - Adjust the ui to suggest the relevant fields to propmt for based on the sync type
